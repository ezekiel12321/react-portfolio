My name is Ezekiel Norman, and I'm excited to share a little bit about myself with you. I'm a passionate developer with experience as a mobile developer.

In addition to my mobile development skills, I also have experience in web development. I'm fluent in React, Javascript, and CSS, and I've used these skills to create beautiful and responsive web applications. I believe that my ability to work in both mobile and web development has given me a unique perspective and has helped me become a more versatile and adaptable developer.
